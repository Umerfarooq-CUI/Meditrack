# ðŸ’Š MediTrack - Medical Store Management System

Hey there! Welcome to **MediTrack**, a simple yet powerful command-line tool I built to help manage medicines in a medical store. Whether you're running a small clinic or just want to keep track of your meds, MediTrack has got your back.

## What Can MediTrack Do?

- **Add & Update Medicines** â€” Easily add new medicines or update existing ones with details like name, quantity, price, expiry date, company, and type.  
- **View Inventory** â€” Check all your medicines at a glance, along with total value per medicine.  
- **Sell Medicines** â€” Sell the exact quantity needed, and it automatically updates your stock.  
- **Search Medicines** â€” Quickly find any medicine by its name.  
- **Smart Validations** â€” No funny business! Expiry dates and quantities are checked to keep your data clean.  
- **Custom Limits** â€” Set your own maximum medicine capacity (default is 500).

## Why I Made MediTrack

I wanted something lightweight and easy to use for beginners (like me!) to manage medicine inventory without the fuss of complicated software. This project also helped me sharpen my Python skills and think about real-world problems like inventory management and data validation. Plus, it's a solid foundation if I or anyone else wants to build on it laterâ€”maybe a GUI or database support.

## Tech Stuff

- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Libraries:** Only built-in Python stuff so no extra installs needed  
- **Platform:** Works on any system with Python installed (Windows, Mac, Linux)

## How to Use It

Getting started is super easy:

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/Umerfarooq-CUI/Meditrack.git
cd Meditrack

# Run the program
python meditrack.py
Once you run it, youâ€™ll see a simple menu like this:

=== Medical Store Management System ===
1. Add Medicine
2. Display Inventory
3. Sell Medicine
4. Search Medicine
5. Exit
Just type the number of what you want to do and follow the prompts. Itâ€™s straightforward and beginner friendly.

Whatâ€™s Next?
Iâ€™m planning to keep improving MediTrack by:

Adding a graphical interface so itâ€™s easier on the eyes

Storing data permanently (maybe using CSV files or a database)

Adding alerts for medicines that are about to expire

Making a small web or mobile app version someday
